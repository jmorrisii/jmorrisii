## Hi there 👋

I'm Jonathan — a network engineer pivoting into **cloud security engineering**.  
With a strong foundation in traditional networking, I'm now focused on building secure, scalable cloud infrastructure and mastering cloud-native security practices.

- 🔭 Currently working through the [LearnToCloud](https://learntocloud.guide/) roadmap — a hands-on, cloud-agnostic path to becoming a strong cloud engineer  
- 🌱 Deepening skills in:  
  • Linux, Bash & infrastructure fundamentals  
  • Python, APIs and cloud automation  
  • Cloud networking (VPCs, subnets, routing, secure remote access)  
  • Cloud platform fundamentals (VMs, IAM, security groups)  
  • DevOps practices (containers, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code)  
  • **Cloud security** (IAM, network security, data protection, secrets management, monitoring & incident response)  
- 👯 Open to collaborating on cloud security tools, secure infrastructure patterns, IaC security scanning, or cloud networking projects  
- 💬 Ask me about traditional networking → cloud migration, zero-trust principles, cloud IAM design, secure remote access, or transitioning from on-prem to cloud security

- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to troubleshoot enterprise network outages at 2 a.m., now I’m learning how to prevent them before they ever happen — in the cloud ☁️🔒

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore my repos or connect if you're also working in cloud, networking, or security. 🚀
